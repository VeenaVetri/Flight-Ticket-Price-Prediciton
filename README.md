# Flight-Ticket-Price-Prediciton
The Flight Ticket Price Prediction project aims to accurately forecast the prices of flight tickets based on a multitude of input parameters. These parameters include the duration of the flight, the number of stops, departure and arrival times, the airline, as well as the source, destination, and route information. 

## Model Comparison
Two prominent machine learning models, Linear Regression and Random Forest, are employed in this project. Through rigorous testing and analysis, it is demonstrated that the Random Forest model outperforms Linear Regression in terms of accuracy, thereby enhancing the reliability of the price predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized for training and validating the models encompasses comprehensive details regarding flight tickets. Key attributes such as flight duration, total stops, departure and arrival times, and airline carrier, as well as source and destination locations, are included. Each entry within the dataset corresponds to a unique flight journey, accompanied by its respective ticket price.
